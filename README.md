## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a passionate Python developer with a focus on data science and machine learning.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

*   **Sentiment Analysis API** - A REST API built with Flask that analyzes the sentiment of text using a pre-trained machine learning model. I'm currently working on improving the accuracy of the model. (Technologies: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, Docker)
*   **Data Visualization Dashboard** - A web dashboard built with React that visualizes data from a PostgreSQL database. I'm currently working on adding interactive filtering and sorting features. (Technologies: JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Chart.js)

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

*   **TensorFlow** - Expanding my knowledge of deep learning frameworks to build more complex machine learning models.  I'm hoping to use it to create more accurate sentiment analysis models.
*   **Kubernetes** - Learning how to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.  My goal is to deploy my Sentiment Analysis API to a Kubernetes cluster.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

*   **Open Source Data Science Projects** - I'm interested in contributing to open-source projects that use data science to solve real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in contributing to projects related to natural language processing. I can help with tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and documentation.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:

*   **Optimizing TensorFlow model performance** - I'm currently struggling with optimizing the performance of my TensorFlow model. I'd appreciate any guidance on techniques such as pruning, quantization, and graph optimization.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

*   **Python Programming** - I'm happy to chat about Python best practices, data structures, algorithms, and more.
*   **Machine Learning** - Feel free to ask me anything related to machine learning, including model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
